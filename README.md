The game is quite simple, get the egg in the basket using a physics bouncing egg.

The project makes use of dynamic shadows being cast, URP and basic physics. 

Developed using Unity by Eggy's Games. It uses a simple coding style of splitting drag and droppable classes custom coded by me. 
Feel free to use any of the code for your own projects.
