=== Information === 

The full source code for Bouncy Egg released by Eggy's Games

You will find all the C# coding under assets/code

You will find all available sprites under assets/sprites

The game is quite simple, get the egg in the basket using a physics bouncing egg.

The project makes use of dynamic shadows being cast, URP and basic physics. 

Developed using Unity by Eggy's Games (Bradley Erkelens). It uses a simple coding style of splitting drag and droppable classes custom coded by me. 

=== Coding === 

You will find most objects all link back to the Main.cs class. This handles everything and communicates with all objects. This handles a variable for detecting if the egg has been dropped with GameIsPlaying() to check if true then the update can keep running.
